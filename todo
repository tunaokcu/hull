Bugs
2)Animation doesn't work.

4)Sometimes load doesn't work
5)Doesn't zoom directly into the cursor 
6)Can handle about 120,000 points before getting:
    Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
    at Graphical.render (Graphical.js:139:66)
    at App.render (App.js:232:24)
    at App.generateUniform (App.js:228:14)
    at HTMLFormElement.<anonymous> (App.js:320:95)
    render @ Graphical.js:139
    render @ App.js:232
    generateUniform @ App.js:228
    (anonymous) @ App.js:320
6)Some ideas for optimization(although the issue seems to be a lack of memory[sort of confirmed by loading the array statically instead of generating it on the page])
