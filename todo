Add
1)Jarvis
2)Merge hull
3)Quickhull -> very small bug
4)Timer
5)Quickhull worst case

Optional
1)Point size manipulation
2)Custom mouse cursor(different cursor while dragging, different cursor while placing point, etc)


Bugs
1)Swapping between algorithms while in animation crashes the app.
2)Animation doesn't work.
3)Animation speed adjustments don't work.
4)Sometimes load doesn't work
5)Doesn't zoom directly into the cursor 
6)Can handle more than 1,000,000 points
6)Some ideas for optimization(although the issue seems to be a lack of memory[sort of confirmed by loading the array statically instead of generating it on the page])
